Description : Recreate the plots shown below from the dataset. 

 

Task 1: The scatterplot below attempts to show the relationship between the days employed versus the age of the person (DAYS_BIRTH) for people who were not unemployed. Note, to reproduce this chart you must remove unemployed people from the dataset first. Also note the sign of the axis, they are both transformed to be positive. Finally, feel free to adjust the alpha and linewidth parameters in the scatterplot since there are so many points stacked on top of each other.

Task 2: Recreate the Distribution Plot shown below: 

Recreate the Distribution Plot shown below:

Note, you will need to figure out how to calculate "Age in Years" from one of the columns in the DF. Think carefully about this. 

 

Task 3: Recreate the Categorical Plot shown below:

This plot shows information only for the bottom half of income earners in the data set. It shows the boxplots for each category of NAME_FAMILY_STATUS column for displaying their distribution of their total income. Note: You will need to adjust or only take part of the dataframe before recreating this plot. You may want to explore the *order* parameter to get the xticks in the exact order shown here
